"Meniere's When" is a project building a data-focused statistical / descriptive analytics and predictive model integrated web mobile app designed to predict vertigo attacks in patients suffering from Meniere's disease.

This project is a work in progress, extensive research will be put into developing this app, sinch Meniere's disease is not very well understood disease. So this app's future prediction should be taken with a grain of salt.

This is for *mi amor*, Jaynie.
